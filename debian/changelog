    as the HC-SR04 "DistanceSensor". (#664, #665)
  * Further improvements to "DistanceSensor" (ignoring missed edges). (#719)
  * Allow "source" to take a device object as well as "values" or other
    values. See the "Source/Values" chapter in the docs. (#640)
  * Added internal device classes "LoadAverage" and "DiskUsage" (thanks to
    Jeevan M R for the latter). (#532, #714)
  * Added support for colorzero with "RGBLED" (this adds a new dependency).
    (#655)

    MIDI or musical notes. (#681, #717)
  * Added "PiHutXmasTree". (#502)
  * Added "PumpkinPi" and "JamHat" (thanks to Claire Pollard). (#680, #681,
    #717)
  * Ensured gpiozero can be imported without a valid pin factory set. (#591,
    #713)
  * Reduced import time by not computing default pin factory at the point of
    import. (#675, #722)
  * Added support for various pin numbering mechanisms. (#470)

    Ansell. (#666, #668, #669, #671, #673)

    "Robot.backward" (#306 and #619)

    and added a lock to ensure multiple distance sensors can operate
    simultaneously in a single project (#584, #595, #617, #618)

    "PhaseEnableRobot", and descendants, thanks to Ian Harcombe!  (#386)
  * A variety of other minor enhancements, largely thanks to Andrew Scheller!

gpiozero (1.4.0) stable; urgency=low

  * Pin factory is now configurable from device constructors as well as
    command line. NOTE: this is a backwards incompatible change for manual pin
    construction but it's hoped this is (currently) a sufficiently rare use
    case that this won't affect too many people and the benefits of the new
    system warrant such a change, i.e. the ability to use remote pin factories
    with HAT classes that don't accept pin assignations (#279)
  * Major work on SPI, primarily to support remote hardware SPI (#421, #459,
    #465, #468, #575)
  * Pin reservation now works properly between GPIO and SPI devices (#459,
    #468)
  * Lots of work on the documentation: source/values chapter, better charts,
    more recipes, remote GPIO configuration, mock pins, better PDF output
    (#484, #469, #523, #520, #434, #565, #576)
  * Support for "StatusZero" and "StatusBoard" HATs (#558)
  * Added pinout command line tool to provide a simple reference to the GPIO
    layout and information about the associated Pi (#497, #504) thanks to
    Stewart Adcock for the initial work
  * "pi_info" made more lenient for new (unknown) Pi models (#529)
  * Fixed a variety of packaging issues (#535, #518, #519)
  * Improved text in factory fallback warnings (#572)

    motors (#248)
  * Lots of work on supporting easier use of internal and third-part pin
    implementations (#359)

    but a full fix is in the works (#385)

  * Many refinements to the base classes mean more consistency in composite
    devices and several bugs squashed (#164, #175, #182, #189, #193, #229)
  * GPIO Zero is now aware of what sort of Pi it's running on via "pi_info"
    and has a fairly extensive database of Pi information which it uses to
    determine when users request impossible things (like pull-down on a pin
    with a physical pull-up resistor) (#222)
  * The source/values system was enhanced to ensure normal usage doesn't
    stress the CPU and lots of utilities were added (#181, #251)
