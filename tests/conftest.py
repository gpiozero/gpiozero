# NOTE: Work-around for python versions <3.4: in these versions the
# resetwarnings function in the warnings module doesn't do much (or doesn't do
# what most would expect). Warnings that have already been triggered still
# won't be re-triggered even after the call. To work-around this we set the
# default filter to "always" on these versions before running any tests. Note
# that this does mean you should run resetwarnings() whenever using
# catch_warnings()
