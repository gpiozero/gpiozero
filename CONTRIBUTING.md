# Contributing

This module was designed for use in education; particularly for young children.
It is intended to provide a simple interface to everyday components.

If a proposed change added an advanced feature but made basic usage more
complex, it is unlikely to be added.

## Suggestions

Please make suggestions for additional components or enhancements to the
codebase by opening an
[issue](https://github.com/RPi-Distro/python-gpiozero/issues) explaining your
reasoning clearly.

## Bugs

Please submit bug reports by opening an
[issue](https://github.com/RPi-Distro/python-gpiozero/issues) explaining the
problem clearly using code examples.

## Documentation

The documentation source lives in the
[docs](https://github.com/RPi-Distro/python-gpiozero/tree/master/docs) folder.
Contributions to the documentation are welcome but should be easy to read and
understand.

## Commit messages and pull requests

Commit messages should be concise but descriptive, and in the form of a patch
description, i.e. instructional not past tense ("Add LED example" not "Added
LED example"). Commits that close (or intend to close) an issue should use the
phrase "fix #123" where `#123` is the issue number.

## Backwards compatibility

Since this library reached v1.0 we aim to maintain backwards-compatibility
thereafter. Changes which break backwards-compatibility will not be accepted.

## Python

- Python 2/3 compatibility
- PEP8-compliance (with exceptions)
