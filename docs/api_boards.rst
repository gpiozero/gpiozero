These additional interfaces are provided to group collections of components
together for ease of use, and as examples. They are composites made up of
components from the various :doc:`api_input` and :doc:`api_output` provided by
GPIO Zero. See those pages for more information on using components
individually.

.. note::

    All GPIO pin numbers use Broadcom (BCM) numbering. See the :doc:`recipes`
    page for more information.
