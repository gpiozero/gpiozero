=====================
Environment Variables
=====================

All utilities provided by GPIO Zero accept the following environment variables:

.. envvar:: GPIOZERO_PIN_FACTORY

    The library to use when communicating with the GPIO pins. Defaults to
    attempting to load lgpio, then gpiod, then RPi.GPIO, then pigpio, and
    finally uses a native Python implementation. Valid values include "lgpio",
    "gpiod", "rpigpio", "pigpio", "native", and "mock". The latter is most
    useful on non-Pi platforms as it emulates a Raspberry Pi model 3B (by
    default).

.. envvar:: PIGPIO_ADDR

    The hostname of the Raspberry Pi the pigpio library should attempt to
    connect to (if the pigpio pin factory is being used). Defaults to
    ``localhost``.

.. envvar:: PIGPIO_PORT

    The port number the pigpio library should attempt to connect to (if the
    pigpio pin factory is being used). Defaults to ``8888``.
