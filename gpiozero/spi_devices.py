    Typical analog input devices are `analog to digital converters`_ (ADCs).
    Several classes are provided for specific ADC chips, including
    :class:`MCP3004`, :class:`MCP3008`, :class:`MCP3204`, and :class:`MCP3208`.

    The following code demonstrates reading the first channel of an MCP3008
    chip attached to the Pi's SPI pins::

        from gpiozero import MCP3008

        pot = MCP3008(0)
        print(pot.value)

    The :attr:`value` attribute is normalized such that its value is always
    between 0.0 and 1.0 (or in special cases, such as differential sampling,
    -1 to +1). Hence, you can use an analog input to control the brightness of
    a :class:`PWMLED` like so::

        from gpiozero import MCP3008, PWMLED

        pot = MCP3008(0)
        led = PWMLED(17)
        led.source = pot

    The :attr:`voltage` attribute reports values between 0.0 and *max_voltage*
    (which defaults to 3.3, the logic level of the GPIO pins).
