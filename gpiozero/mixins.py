    Extends :class:`GPIOThread`. Provides a background thread that monitors a
    device's values and provides a running *average* (defaults to median) of
    those values. If the *parent* device includes the :class:`EventsMixin` in
    its ancestry, the thread automatically calls
    :meth:`~EventsMixin._fire_events`.
