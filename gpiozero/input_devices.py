class InputDevice(GPIODevice):

    Represents a generic GPIO input device.

    This class extends :class:`GPIODevice` to add facilities common to GPIO
    input devices. The constructor adds the optional *pull_up* parameter to
    specify how the pin should be pulled by the internal resistors. The
    :attr:`is_active` property is adjusted accordingly so that :data:`True`
    still means active regardless of the *pull_up* setting.

    :type pin: int or str
    :param pin:
        The GPIO pin that the device is connected to. See :ref:`pin-numbering`

    :param pull_up:
        If :data:`True`, the pin will be pulled high with an internal resistor.
        If :data:`False` (the default), the pin will be pulled low.  If
        :data:`None`, the pin will be floating. As gpiozero cannot
        automatically guess the active state when not pulling the pin, the
        *active_state* parameter must be passed.

    :type active_state: bool or None
    :param active_state:
        If :data:`True`, when the hardware pin state is ``HIGH``, the software
        pin is ``HIGH``. If :data:`False`, the input polarity is reversed: when
        the hardware pin state is ``HIGH``, the software pin state is ``LOW``.
        Use this parameter to set the active state of the underlying pin when
        configuring it as not pulled (when *pull_up* is :data:`None`) or when
        you deliberately want to override what is considered the active state.
        When *pull_up* is :data:`True` or :data:`False` and this parameter is
        :data:`None`, the active state is by default set to :data:`False` and
        :data:`True` respectively.

class SmoothedInputDevice(EventsMixin, InputDevice):

    Represents a generic input device which takes its value from the average of
    a queue of historical values.

    This class extends :class:`InputDevice` with a queue which is filled by a
    background thread which continually polls the state of the underlying
    device. The average (a configurable function) of the values in the queue is
    compared to a threshold which is used to determine the state of the
    :attr:`is_active` property.

    .. note::

        The background queue is not automatically started upon construction.
        This is to allow descendents to set up additional components before the
        queue starts reading values. Effectively this is an abstract base
        class.

    This class is intended for use with devices which either exhibit analog
    behaviour (such as the charging time of a capacitor with an LDR), or those
    which exhibit "twitchy" behaviour (such as certain motion sensors).

    :type pin: int or str
    :param pin:
        The GPIO pin that the device is connected to. See :ref:`pin-numbering`
        for valid pin numbers. If this is :data:`None` a :exc:`GPIODeviceError`
        will be raised.

    :type pull_up: bool or None

    :type active_state: bool or None
    :param active_state:
        See description under :class:`InputDevice` for more information.

    :param float threshold:
        The value above which the device will be considered "on".

    :param int queue_len:
        The length of the internal queue which is filled by the background
        thread.

    :param float sample_wait:
        The length of time to wait between retrieving the state of the
        underlying device. Defaults to 0.0 indicating that values are retrieved
        as fast as possible.

    :param bool partial:
        If :data:`False` (the default), attempts to read the state of the
        device (from the :attr:`is_active` property) will block until the queue
        has filled.  If :data:`True`, a value will be returned immediately, but
        be aware that this value is likely to fluctuate excessively.

    :param average:
        The function used to average the values in the internal queue. This
        defaults to :func:`statistics.median` which is a good selection for
        discarding outliers from jittery sensors. The function specified must
        accept a sequence of numbers and return a single number.

    :type ignore: frozenset or None
    :param ignore:
        The set of values which the queue should ignore, if returned from
        querying the device's value.

    Extends :class:`DigitalInputDevice` and represents a simple push button

    Connect one side of the button to a ground pin, and the other to any GPIO
    pin. Alternatively, connect one side of the button to the 3V3 pin, and the
    other to any GPIO pin, then set *pull_up* to :data:`False` in the
    :class:`Button` constructor.

    The defaults are tuned to normally-open buttons and switches (i.e. switch
    contact shorts when pressed, and is open circuit when released). If you have
    a normally-closed button (switch contact opens when pressed, but shorts when

        case, connect the other side of the button to 3V3. If :data:`None`, the
        pin will be floating, so it must be externally pulled up or down and
        the ``active_state`` parameter must be set accordingly.

class DistanceSensor(SmoothedInputDevice):
    """
    Extends :class:`SmoothedInputDevice` and represents an HC-SR04 ultrasonic
    distance sensor, as found in the `CamJam #3 EduKit`_.

    The distance sensor requires two GPIO pins: one for the *trigger* (marked
    TRIG on the sensor) and another for the *echo* (marked ECHO on the sensor).
    However, a voltage divider is required to ensure the 5V from the ECHO pin
    doesn't damage the Pi. Wire your sensor according to the following
    instructions:

    1. Connect the GND pin of the sensor to a ground pin on the Pi.

    2. Connect the TRIG pin of the sensor a GPIO pin.

    3. Connect one end of a 330Ω resistor to the ECHO pin of the sensor.

    4. Connect one end of a 470Ω resistor to the GND pin of the sensor.

    5. Connect the free ends of both resistors to another GPIO pin. This forms
       the required `voltage divider`_.

    6. Finally, connect the VCC pin of the sensor to a 5V pin on the Pi.

    Alternatively, the 3V3 tolerant HC-SR04P sensor (which does not require a
    voltage divider) will work with this class.


    .. note::

        If you do not have the precise values of resistor specified above,
        don't worry! What matters is the *ratio* of the resistors to each
        other.

        You also don't need to be absolutely precise; the `voltage divider`_
        given above will actually output ~3V (rather than 3.3V). A simple 2:3
        ratio will give 3.333V which implies you can take three resistors of
        equal value, use one of them instead of the 330Ω resistor, and two of
        them in series instead of the 470Ω resistor.

        For improved accuracy, use the pigpio pin driver rather than the default
        RPi.GPIO driver (pigpio uses DMA sampling for much more precise edge
        timing). This is particularly relevant if you're using Pi 1 or Pi Zero.

    :param int queue_len:

    :param float max_distance:
        The :attr:`value` attribute reports a normalized value between 0 (too

    pins on your Pi. Then simply specify the A and B pins as the arguments when

        If this is 0, then the encoder's :attr:`value` never changes, but you
